CSSproject
==========

My first assignment for my Intermediate Web Design class. Coded the page from a Photoshop file (see COMP.psd) without using any JavaScript or JQuery. Pure CSS and HTML. The purpose of the assignment was to push our CSS skills to another level. This a one page project and lacks full functionality per the limitations of the assignment.
