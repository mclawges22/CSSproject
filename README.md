CSSproject
==========

First assignment for my Intermediate Web Design class. Had to code the page from a Photoshop file without using any JavaScript or JQuery. Pure CSS and HTML. The purpose of the assignment was to push our CSS skills to another level. This a one page project and lacks full functionality per the limitations of the assignment.
